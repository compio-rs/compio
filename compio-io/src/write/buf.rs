/// Wraps a writer and buffers its output.
///
/// It can be excessively inefficient to work directly with something that
/// implements [`AsyncWrite`].  A `BufWriter<W>` keeps an in-memory buffer of
/// data and writes it to an underlying writer in large, infrequent batches.
//
/// `BufWriter<W>` can improve the speed of programs that make *small* and
/// *repeated* write calls to the same file or network socket. It does not
/// help when writing very large amounts at once, or writing just one or a few
/// times. It also provides no advantage when writing to a destination that is
/// in memory, like a `Vec<u8>`.
///
/// Dropping `BufWriter<W>` also discards any bytes left in the buffer, so it is
/// critical to call [`flush`] before `BufWriter<W>` is dropped. Calling
/// [`flush`] ensures that the buffer is empty and thus no data is lost.
///
