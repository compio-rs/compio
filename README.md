A thread-per-core Rust runtime with IOCP/io_uring/polling.
The name comes from "completion-based IO".
This crate is inspired by [monoio](https://github.com/bytedance/monoio/).

## Why not Tokio?

Tokio is a great generic-purpose async runtime.
However, it is poll-based, and even uses [undocumented APIs](https://notgull.net/device-afd/) on Windows.
We would like some new high-level APIs to perform IOCP/io_uring.

Unlike `tokio-uring`, this runtime isn't Tokio-based.
This is mainly because that no public APIs to control IOCP in `mio`,
and `tokio` won't expose APIs to control `mio` before `mio` reaches 1.0.

## Why not monoio/tokio-uring/glommio?

They don't support Windows.

## Quick start

Add `compio` as dependency:

```
compio = { version = "0.13.1", features = ["macros"] }
```

Then we can use high level APIs to perform filesystem & net IO.

```rust
use compio::{fs::File, io::AsyncReadAtExt};

#[compio::main]
async fn main() {
    let file = File::open("Cargo.toml").await.unwrap();
    let (read, buffer) = file.read_to_end_at(Vec::with_capacity(1024), 0).await.unwrap();
    assert_eq!(read, buffer.len());
    let buffer = String::from_utf8(buffer).unwrap();
    println!("{}", buffer);
}
```

You can also control the low-level driver manually. See `driver` example of the repo.
